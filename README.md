And the World smiled back at him.

Hello future me, or anyone stumbling upon this repository.

Present me has plentiful of ideas that he would like to make reality, all while juggling university courses.
The guy behind the screen really enjoys Magic: The Gathering, Commander being his favourite format.
University is really strange with everything being online; learning through a computer screen is completely new to the young fellow.
I have yet to fully commit to learning, doing the readings, and completing the assignments, but I am sure there is nothing to fear.
Things are going to become ACADEMIC in this bedroom.

Cheers,
